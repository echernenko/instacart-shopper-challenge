# Instacart Shopper Challenge

Instructions to run:
- `npm start` in project folder
- the server is accesible at localhost:3000
- Latest version of node is required.
- (optional) you can add sample applicants.sqlite3 file or
  it will be created autometically in db/ folder
- analysis script currently runs only under /analysis.json
  endpoint via webserver; I've installed package json2csv
  and was planning to feed to it .json to produce output in
  .csv format

Optional commands:
- linting files `npm run lint`
- testing (more tests to be added) `npm test`

How was it done:
- Both FE and BE are in JS
- FE uses Bootstrap + some simple css
